Here is a unique version of your experiment, focusing on a scenario related to fitness and nutrition.

### **Ex.No.3 - Scenario-Based Report on Fitness & Nutrition Information Retrieval**
### **DATE:** 17-09-2025
### **NAME:** JAGADEESH P
### **REGISTER NUMBER:** 212223230083


### Aim
To write and evaluate prompts for the following prompt engineering types based on a fitness and nutrition scenario: 1. Straightforward Prompts, 2. Tabular Format Prompting, 3. Preceding Question Prompting, and 4. Missing Word Prompting.

### Procedure
### Prompting

### 1. Straightforward Prompts
### Prompt
"Explain the benefits of compound exercises for building muscle."
### ChatGPT
Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses work multiple muscle groups simultaneously, stimulating greater muscle fiber recruitment. This leads to increased testosterone and growth hormone release, promoting overall muscle growth more efficiently than isolation exercises. They also improve intermuscular coordination and functional strength.
### Gemini
Compound exercises are effective for muscle building because they use several muscles at once. This saves time in the gym and burns more calories compared to single-joint movements. Exercises like pull-ups and squats help you get stronger for everyday activities.

### 2. Tabular Format Prompting
### Prompt
"Provide a table comparing the nutritional profiles of whey protein isolate and whey protein concentrate per serving."
### ChatGPT
| Feature | Whey Protein Isolate | Whey Protein Concentrate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Protein Content | Higher (around 90%) | Lower (around 80%) |
| Lactose | Very low to none | Low |
| Fat | Very low | Low |
| Processing | More filtered | Less filtered |
### Gemini
| Type | Protein | Carbs/Fat | Good For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Isolate | More protein | Less | Lactose sensitive people |
| Concentrate | Less protein | More | General use, budget-friendly|

### 3. Preceding Question Prompting
### Prompt
"I am trying to lose fat while preserving the muscle I've built from calisthenics. What is a caloric deficit and why is it important?"
### ChatGPT
A caloric deficit occurs when you consume fewer calories than your body expends for energy. It is fundamentally important for fat loss because it forces your body to use its stored fat as an alternative energy source. To preserve muscle during this phase, it's crucial to maintain a high protein intake and continue with resistance training like your calisthenics routine.
### Gemini
A caloric deficit means eating less energy than you burn. Your body then uses stored fat for fuel, which is why it is the key to losing weight and body fat.

### 4. Missing Word Prompting
### Prompt
"Progressive overload means gradually increasing the stress placed on your muscles over time. For example, you can increase the weight, reps, or ____."
### ChatGPT
"number of sets."
### Gemini
"training volume."

### **Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy & Clarity)**
| Prompt Type | ChatGPT Accuracy | ChatGPT Clarity | Gemini Accuracy | Gemini Clarity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Straightforward Prompts | 5/5 (explains physiological mechanism) | 4/5 (uses technical terms) | 4/5 (correct but simpler) | 5/5 (very easy to understand) |
| Tabular Format Prompting | 5/5 (detailed and specific) | 5/5 (well-structured table) | 4/5 (less detailed, but correct) | 4/5 (simpler categories) |
| Preceding Question Prompt | 5/5 (contextualizes answer to user goal) | 5/5 (clear and actionable advice) | 4/5 (correct but very brief) | 4/5 (lacks detail on preserving muscle) |
| Missing Word Prompting | 5/5 (provides a correct and common variable) | 5/5 (very clear example) | 5/5 (provides a correct, broader term) | 4/5 (less specific than "sets") |

### **Result**
The experiment was successfully conducted to evaluate responses from ChatGPT and Gemini using four distinct prompting techniques in a fitness and nutrition context. Both models provided relevant answers, with performance varying in terms of detail and clarity.
